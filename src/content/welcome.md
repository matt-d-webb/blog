:wave: Hello, welcome to my blog! This is my first post which is hopefully the beginning of some regularly contributions. 

I decided to combine a number of different things I am doing and write about them all here on this blog.

The first thing to note, my blog is written and maintained solely by me. The code, should you wish to view it, can be found here, to clone it and use it for yourself do the following:

[blog](https://github.com/matt-d-webb/blog)

```
git clone https://github.com/matt-d-webb/blog --depth=1 && rm -rf .git
```

The site is built with Gatsby, a front end static site generation tool. It uses a Ghost blog theme and is deployed via Netlify. I have also custom integrated Firebase and One Signal for backend services. Including some AWS Lambda functions via the Netlify functions API.

The plan with the blog is to cover a number of topics, the main ones are:

* Executive MBA 
  * I am currently studing for a Masters in Business Administration in order to strengthen my knowledge with the strategic business areas.
* Programming
  * I love writing a bit of code from time to time so this is a good opportunity to continue doing that whilst giving me an outlet to show some struggles I am having

  ```
  try {
    about = JSON.parse('/about.json');
  } catch (err) {
    throw new Error("Not the best start");
  }
  ```
* Book
  * I have been busy writing a book in my spare time, after various chess endeavours and physical pursuits I wanted to document my ideas and throughts for a future challenge.
* Career
  * For those that know me thye will know I am tremendously ambitious and have big, impossible dreams for my future. I hope to document these ideas and the ways I plan to tackle them.
